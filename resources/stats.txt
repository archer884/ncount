# Test Title

Each morning began with Grier pretending to wake. Margaret's alarm sounded at half past seven, and the two took breakfast downstairs in silence. Their hosts, an elderly French couple, spoke little English, and Grier spoke practically no French; Margaret engaged in cursory conversation, but often Grier heard her name, or caught the word *fille* when Mrs. Denicourt glanced toward her.

She told her father that she had found a gym to join and that she was enjoying her time in France. He didn't believe her, but the lie comforted them both when they talked. Pretending to be happy was almost as good as happiness.

The Denicourts lived on the northern fringe of Paris, so each day after breakfast Grier and Margaret took one bus into the city, walked four blocks, and took a second bus to the university. Grier had enrolled in four classes and attended two each day; Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, her last lecture of the day was taught by Margaret--Miss Reed to her students. For the first week, it seemed the only words Margaret spoke to her were in that class. Grier was satisfied with that arrangement.

Not happy, perhaps. But it was better to pretend to be happy. Today, however, Margaret spoke.

"I looked at the schedule, you know," she said on their way back from the university. "We can stop at this cafe, have a snack, and take the next bus at 3:45."

Grier, following close behind Margaret, stopped when Margaret stopped but did not respond.

"I'm a little hungry," said Margaret. "Do you mind if we...?"

"No," said Grier. Then, worried Margaret would hear that as a refusal, she added, "I don't mind."

Grier sat at a table on the walk outside, while Margaret ordered *caf√© au lait* and a croissant. When Margaret joined her, Grier hid her head in her hands, massaging her eyebrows. She could never make the right one lay flat.
