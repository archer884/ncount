# Test Document

Hello, world![^footnote]

[^footnote]: This is a footnote. I am now embiggening the footnote so that there is additional text to be skipped over. I'm worried this may not be working correctly for longer notes, but of course I have no way to know that for sure.

<!-- Footnotes are annoying to skip in counting. -->

## Further testing required

They're far more annoying than actual notes and comments.

<note tag="foo" comment="Pretty sure notes and comments are being correctly skipped.">

But I am equally sure that footnotes are *not.*

## Turns out I'm wrong.

What if, instead, the problem is that notes are being too "skipped?"

<note tag="bar" comment="I'm worried this note will be conjoined with the previous note by the ... uh. You know, the thing.">

That would mean that the text above, between the two notes, will remain uncounted.
